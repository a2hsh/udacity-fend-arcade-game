# Arcade Game- Udacity project,
by Abdulaziz Alshmasi.

## Introduction
This game is an implementation of the Frogger game. Run toward the water avoiding the beetles.

## How to Play

1. clone and unzip this repo.
2. click on "index.html".
3. navigate in the map using the up, down, left, and right arrow keys.
4. Enjoy!

## The Grading System
When beginning the game, you will be on level 1, and your health will be at 100%. You have to cross the map and reach the water. Getting hit by beetles will decrease your health, and if it drops to 0, the game will be over.
Your score will encrease as you cross the map successfully until it reaches 5, then you will level up, and the score will return to 0. Leveling up will encrease enemies speed, as well as their damage if you ever got hit. You win the game after finishing level 3.

## To do's

Here are some stuff I'd like to do in the future to refine this game:
1. Add accessibility support using Web Audio API. (Currently in progress).
2. ad touch support.
3. Adding more levels, items, stuff to  make the game more fun.

## Happy Playing!
